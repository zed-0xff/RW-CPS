## TSS (Test Subject Storage)
Pawns are stored in the individual capsules, in a conveyor-like rotating facility.
Their basic needs are satisfied, but don't expect them to be happy while inside the TSS.
The space is tight and forced sleep causes nightmares.
Warranty void if kept without power for more than 2 hours.
